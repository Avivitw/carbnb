# Carbnb

## Description

The Airbnb of the automotive world. Users can list their vehicles and towed trailers for rent, set availability, and rates. Users can also choose to rent vehicles listed by other users by browsing the vehicles available for rent for a given location and time frame. Renters can review the vehicles and people they have rentded from, while those who rent their vehicles can review the people who rented from them. Renters will also be able to filter available vehicles by date, location, price, type of vehicle, and from their favourites.
